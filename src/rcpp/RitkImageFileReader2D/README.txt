Description: ITK --> R data transfer testing.
	     Read a given 2D image file from the disk into a numeric vector 
	     in R. Supported image file formats are all those supported by 
	     the 'ImageFileReader' class in ITK library.
Files: itkImageFileReader2D.cpp
		-- implements the interface between C++ and R using Rcpp
       ITKImageFileReader2D.cxx
		-- actual implementation of the image file reader
       CMakeLists.txt
		-- to be used to build shared objects
       README.txt
		-- this file
Usage: 
       ITK should built to create SHARED libraries. To do so, compile
       ITK with 'BUILD_SHARED_LIB' turned ON.      

       All the files above are in the directory 'ITKImageFileReader'.

       $ pwd
		/ ... / ... /ITKImageFileReader

       create a build directory anywhere you please. For now lets say it is
       in the directory with sources and it is named 'build'. Enter the build
       directory.

       $ mkdir build
       $ cd build

       Invoke cmake build system to use the CMakeLists.txt provided with the
       sources.

       $ ccmake ../

       In the configure window, set the ITK_DIR to the build directory of ITK.
       Note that this build directory specified must contain the SHARED 
       libraries to be used by external programs. Set the path to the R and 
       Rcpp include and library files if they are incorrect. Hit configure.
       Makefile is generated by cmake in the end. Invoke make.

       $ make

       This should create the shared library 'ITKImageFileReader2D_impl'
       and 'itkImageFileReader' in the 'build' directory.

       Now start 'R' anywhere.

       $ R

       Load the library dynamically at run-time within R.

       > dyn.load( "<path-to-itkImageFileReader2D.so>" ) ;

       Call the routine provided by the library, pass it an image filename and receive
       a numric vector corresponding to pixel values in the image.

       > .Call( "itkImageFileReader2D" , "<path-to-a-2D-iamge>" ) ;

       Try with 'ITK/Examples/Data/FatMRISlice.png' as the image.
