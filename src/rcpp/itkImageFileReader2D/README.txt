Description: ITK --> R data transfer testing.
	     Read a given 2D image file from the disk into a numeric vector 
	     in R. Supported image file formats are all those supported by 
	     the 'ImageFileReader' class in ITK library.
Files: itkImageFileReader2D.cpp
		-- implements the interface between C++ and R using Rcpp
       ITKImageFileReader2D.cxx
		-- actual implementation of the image file reader
       CMakeLists.txt
		-- to be used to compile ITKImageFileReader.cxx
       README.txt
		-- this file
Usage: 
       ITK should built to create SHARED libraries. To do so, compile
       ITK with 'BUILD_SHARED_LIB' turned ON.      

       All the files above are in the directory 'ITKImageFileReader'.

       $ pwd
		/ ... / ... /ITKImageFileReader

       create a build directory anywhere you please. For now lets say it is
       in the directory with sources and it is named 'build'. Enter the build
       directory.

       $ mkdir build
       $ cd build

       Invoke cmake build system to use the CMakeLists.txt provided with the
       sources.

       $ ccmake ../

       In the configure window, set the ITK_DIR to the build directory of ITK.
       Note that this build directory specified must contain the SHARED 
       libraries to be used by external programs. Makefile is generated by 
       cmake in the end. Invoke make.

       $ make

       This should create the shared library 'libITKImageFileReader2D.so'
       or equivalent in the 'build' directory. Now use the following commands
       to compile the interface source file. REMEMBER to have the right paths
       for your system.

       $ g++ -fpic -O3 -g -c ../itkImageFileReader2D.cpp \
       	     -o itkImageFileReader2D.o \
       	     -I/usr/share/R/include \
	     -I/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/Rcpp/include

       Now link the object file created above to the library created before to
       finally arrive at another shared library.

       $ g++ -shared -o itkImageFileReader2D.so itkImageFileReader2D.o \
       	     -L/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/Rcpp/lib -lRcpp \
	     -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/Rcpp/lib \ 
	     -L/usr/lib/R/lib -lR \
	     -Wl,-rpath,/usr/lib/R/lib \
	     -L/home/shrik/spinner/Spinner/src/rcpp/itkImageFileReader2D/build \
	     -lITKImageFileReader2D \
	     -Wl,-rpath,/home/shrik/spinner/Spinner/src/rcpp/itkImageFileReader2D/build

       This should create a shared library named 'itkImageFileReader2D.so' ready 
       to be loaded and used in R.

       Now start 'R' anywhere.

       $ R

       Load the library dynamically at run-time within R.

       > dyn.load( "<path-to-itkImageFileReader2D.so>" ) ;

       Call the routine provided by the library, pass it an image filename and receive
       a numric vector corresponding to pixel values in the image.

       > .Call( "itkImageFileReader2D" , "<path-to-a-2D-iamge>" ) ;

       Try with 'ITK/Examples/Data/FatMRISlice.png' as the image.
