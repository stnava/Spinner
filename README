#******** Layout of current framework ******#

src/discom2asl --- should work for 4D and mosaic data

src/push2pacs  --- should pass information to pacs 

testing    --- unit tests for above  

data       --- reference data for tests

#********* User Experience ********#

should run dicom2asl on dicom directory for asl and get 

subjectID/timepoint/asl/subjectID_timepoint_asl*.nii.gz

should derive some data with a asl2cbf script and post-processing 

should then push2pacs
